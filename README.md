# Calc You Later

Today we're going to be building a basic calculator. Don't worry, it's way easier than it sounds!


### Objectives

You'll be able to:

* Convert strings to numbers.
* Separate your logic from your interface.


### Basics

This is a test-driven app. You'll do most of your work in `calculate.js`, looking at the tests in `calculate.test.js` for reference, and running `npm test` in a dedicated terminal to watch your progress. Don't forget to run `npm install` first, though!

Once you've got a good `calculate` function that passes all the tests, we can use it in a full-scale app that can take user input. We'll do that in the `calc-you-later.js` file. You'll grab the user's input, call the `calculate` function we're pulling in with the user's input instead of the examples we're using in our tests, and console out the return value.
